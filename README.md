This repo is an attempt to make it easier for people to find places to work in London - which places have free wifi? Which have power? Is it noisy? etc.

|  North London | Archway | Bread and Bean |  | Fine |  |  | Mainly fancy sandwiches and cakes, and a few other options. | ££ | All nice; although some a little brusque at times | 3.5 |  | Looks quite small from the outside, but there's a back room as well so don't worry if looks busy from outside. |
|  Central London | Bank | Merchant House of Bow Lane | http://www.merchanthouselondon.com/bow-lane | Sometimes flaky but usually quite passable |  |  | Cocktail bar with good tea and coffee, some small plates | ££ | Extremely friendly and chilled out, during the day they like the company more than the cash | 5 | £3.50 | Open from 11am until late. Best cocktails in London when you're finished working ;) |
|  Central London | Bankside | Citizen M | https://www.citizenm.com/destinations/london/london-bankside-hotel | Excellent | No password, just accept their T&Cs | Plentiful | Breakfast & Lunch buffets. Fully stocked bar. | ££ | Very friendly | 5 | £2.50 | Walk into the hotel lobby and sit down. <br/>Plenty of times I've bought nothing if it's busy enough to get away with it. |
|  South-west London | Battersea | Battersea Arts Centre | www.bac.org.uk | Good and consistent | Open network | Plenty | Limited food | £ | Really friendly and good atmosphere. Gets busy around performances, but in downtime it is often empty. | 5 | 2 | Can get very noisy in peak times. |
|  South-west London | Battersea | Social Pantry | https://socialpantry.co.uk | Good | Open network | Limited – best spot is the big table down the end. | Good brunch menu and fresh salads bowls for lunch. | ££ | Staff quite pushy about buying more if you're there over an hour. Stagger your food! | 4 | 3 | Don't sit under the air con supply. It drips and I left with a soaking bag :( |
|  East London | Bethnal Green | The Common E2 |  | Very good |  |  | Great breakfast dishes | ££ | Real nice | 5 |  | loads of people on laptops |
|  Central London | Blackfriars | Merchant House of Fleet Street | http://www.merchanthouselondon.com/fleet-street/ | Sometimes flaky but usually quite passable |  |  | Cocktail bar with good tea and coffee, some small plates | ££ | Extremely friendly and chilled out, during the day they like the company more than the cash | 5 | £3.50 | Open from 3pm until late. Smashing cocktails once you're off the clock |
|  Central London | BLOOMSBURY | Continental Stores (and its sister cafe, store street) |  | Alright - but staff sometimes turn off over lunch |  |  | A whole galaxy of fancy herbal teas and hippie lattes, salads and sandwiches, cakes that look more delicious than they are. | ££ | Very lovely. | 4 |  | Store street gets CRAZY at lunch - but it opens early |
|  Central London | BLOOMSBURY | Dillons Coffee at Waterstones Gower Street |  | Can be pretty slow |  |  | Cakes and toasties, decent coffee | ££ | All nice | 4 |  | The wifi isn't great, but it's big and thanks to being right near lots of universities is actually mostly filled with people working, which makes for a peaceful atmosphere and means staff leave you be. |
|  Central London | BLOOMSBURY | Institute of Historical Research Library and Common Room | http://www.history.ac.uk/library | yes for members +eduroam |  |  | Jacket spuds, panini, sandwiches, cakes! | £ | Lovely | 4 |  | For budding historical fiction writers... Free for academics and gradute students; day or £52 per annum memberships. Try the 3rd floor for a quiet spot. |
|  South London | BRIXTON | Stir Coffee | http://www.stircoffee.co.uk/ | Good |  |  | Decent coffee, cakes, sandwiches, salads, canned craft beer | ££ | Bit over the top | 4 |  | Hipstery, but in a Brixton way, with a relaxed, friendly vibe. Even at its busiest never failed to find a seat. The kind of place you can stay for hours without worrying. |
|  South London | BRIXTON | The Ritzy |  | Good |  |  | Quite pricey coffee, good food with lots of choice. Also a bar for when work is getting tough. | £££ | All nice | 3 |  | Don't mind you being there a while, but only really a good idea to go during the day -- it's a cinema so gets packed in the evening. Head to the upstairs cafe/bar rather than the downstairs one. |
|  South London | BROCKLEY | NOAK |  | slightly dodgy |  |  | Cinnamon buns for days | ££ | Everyone's cool here. | 4 |  | I've had issues with the wifi cutting out before |
|  South London | CAMBERWELL | Lumberjack | https://wearelumberjack.co.uk/ | good |  |  | Good cakes. Seriously good cakes... | ££ | Largely very sweet; almost all of them seem to be actors/musicians so good for eavesdropping when bored... | 4 |  | Pretty small, so not necessarily somewhere you can guarantee a table, but very chilled, quite arty vibe. |
|  North London | CAMDEN TOWN | Yumchaa |  | Free, but connection is unreliable. But a neighbouring shop has a guest wifi network that can be accessed. |  |  | "A whole galaxy of fancy herbal teas and hippie lattes, salads and sandwiches, cakes that look more delicious than they are." Yumchaa is a chain: been to one, been to them all. But the cakes are amazing. | ££ | Always perfectly pleasant | 4 | £2.50-£4.00 | UPDATE: Due to the landlord increasing the rent, the Yumchaa on Parkway has closed down. The one in Camden Market's food court is still open, but it's not laptop-user friendly – pen-and-paper writers will be fine, if they can snag a table from tourists. Yumchaa is a chain, so if you've been to one you know what to expect. |
|  Central London | CANNON STREET | Joe and the Juice |  | Pretty good |  |  | They charged me 50p for a lemon slice | £££ | A man called me "darling" five times | 2 |  | Phat beats, armageddon on the streets. |
|  South-east London | Catford 🐈🐈🐈 | Archibald's |  | Excellent |  |  | Lunch/brunch - fairly predictable but good food | ££ | Friendly, chatty | 3.5 |  | Relaxed atmosphere. Sometimes fills up with buggies and mums, but often very quiet and chill. Importantly, there are loads of plug sockets and the wifi is good. |
|  Central London | CHARING CROSS | Upper Crust ( I think) |  | Excellent (in-station sky.com) |  |  | Er, don't know, I just bought a banana so I could sit there | ? | Good | 4 | ? | Only including this half remembered entry because, like the author above, I fought and lost against the Waterstones Wifi. Go into Charing Cross station along the "Cab Road Passage" ( http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/static/images/content/SME/1485-0000002.jpg ) and turn right immediately, the space is open, has many chairs, power, good station WiFi and you can "hide" around the corner if need be. |
|  Central London | CHARING CROSS | Waterstone's Cafe |  | Awful |  |  | It's a Costa so obviously I'm not going to eat there | ££ | The woman in there was definitely over my shit | 1 |  | Seriously, no one could work the wifi, it was Lord of the Flies |
|  South-west London | Chelsea | Raw Press |  | Good, fast | healthynothard | Lots | All vegan. Lots of juices. Not sure how to feel about it, but also quite nice? Lots of salads |  | Fine |  |  |  |

|  South-west London | CLAPHAM | Tart |  | Very good | t@styt@rt | Some. | Tarts (three on rotation it seems), the odd sandwhich and coffee/tea. Of course, you're there for the tart though | £££ | Delightful | 4 |  | Genuinely nice tarts (as you may have guessed by now) and a great pace to take a laptop. Not every table has plugs, however. Toilets have wheelchair access. |
|  South-west London | CLAPHAM | The Black Lab | http://blacklabcoffee.com/ | Very good |  |  | Toasted sandwiches (a bit ££), good loaf cakes, pastries etc. V. good coffee. | ££ | Lovely | 5 |  | Have spent eight hour stretches there. Power points at various places. Good tables for working on. |
|  South London | CRYSTAL PALACE/<br/>SYDENHAM | Brown & Green |  | Good |  |  | Nice coffee, breakfasts etc. | ££ | Nice people | 4 |  | Isn't the biggest place and buggaboo central at certain times, but know of people who've written whole books in here. two CP locations (one in the 'triangle', the other in the station), and Sydenham one in Mayow Park. |
|  East London | Dalston | To The Jungle |  | Good |  |  | Pretty much just sandwiches and pastries | ££ | Nice, fairly hands-off, won't hassle you to leave earlier than you want | 4 |  | Plenty of plug sockets, never struggled to get a seat there. Point knocked off because the menu is a bit boring and the seats aren't very comfortable but I am probably being unnecessarily harsh. |
|  South-East London | DEPTFORD | London Velo |  | excellent |  |  | Also largely fine | ££ | Everone's cool here | 4 |  | It's also a bike shop? Don't know what that's about. |
|  South-East London | DEPTFORD | Mousetail | http://www.mousetailcoffee.com/#ourlocations | excellent |  |  | Real good banana bread | ££ | Everyone's cool here. | 5 |  | it's kinda dark so you'll get SAD if you sit here for too long |

|  North London | EAST FINCHLEY | Caffe Nero | https://caffenero.com/uk/stores/east-finchley/ | Good |  | Yes | Standard Caffe Nero | £ | Standard Caffe Nero | 4 | Standard Caffe Nero | About 5-7 minute walk from East Finchley Station. Surprisingly large branch, with a long table suitable for packs of writers, and plenty of small tables in booths. Most tables seem to have power points nearby and there is WiFi. Everything else is what you usually find at a Caffe Nero. |
|  Central London | Euston | British Library |  | very good |  |  | wide range of food in cafe. no food allowed in library bit | ££ | leave you alone | 5 |  |  |
|  North London | EUSTON | Friends House Cafe | http://www.friendshouse.co.uk/getting-here | They give you a code that lasts an hour when you buy a coffee. |  |  | Nice cakes, sandwiches etc - plus tea and coffee are super cheap | £ | Nice | 4 | £2 -ish - tea is about £1 | Very near Euston Station |
|  Central London | FARRINGDON | Ask For Janice | http://askforjanice.co.uk | Great |  |  | Full menus. Separate Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner menus. | ££ | Great | 5 |  | Staff very happy to leave you for hours whilst you work. Coffee is excellent, food is great, healthy and well priced. They also have an excellent gin and beer selection. Gets busy during lunch and from about 5pm. Outside of those times you should always find a comfortable table. |
|  Central London | FARRINGDON | Smiths Of Smithfield |  | Good |  |  | Quality breakfasts, free coffee refills until 2PM | £ | Reasonable | 4 |  | Turns into a bar after 2pm, you can stay but it gets loud and annoying. Easily the nicest open space & largest tables around here |
|  Central London | Finchley Central | Bespoke cafe | https://www.facebook.com/bespoke.Cafe/ | Consistently fine. |  |  | Excellent coffee, avo on toast, soups of the day, good breakfast menu, and green smoothies | £ | Friendly owner and staff | 4 |  | Lovely indie cafe that is not terribly expensive. Does not get too busy in the afternoons, not too many charging points (about 2-3) |
|  Central London | Finchley Central | Tintico | https://www.facebook.com/tinticocoffee/ | Consistently fine. |  |  | Very nice coffee, menu of various egg on toast, avocado toast type dishes. Reasonable range of cakes. | ££ | Lovely staff | 4 |  | Can get a bit busy |
|  North London | Finsbury Park | Vagabond | http://www.vagabond.london/ | Always strong |  | There is a plug socket but it's above the door | Excellent, rocket fuel coffee, basic brunchy menu of eggs on toast etc, and cake. | £ | Lovely staff, cool neighbourhood vibe | 4 |  | Crucially, no plug sockets. Which is a pain – but sometimes also the incentive you need to work and stop dicking around? |
|  South-east London | GREENWICH  🕒🕒🕒 | Waterstone's Cafe, 2nd floor |  | Waterstone's WIFI is always horrible, but you can crab 🦀 WIFI from the M&S downstairs pretty easy |  |  | I had a cookie and it was ok | ££ | Everyone's fine, if sort of non-plussed, which I get | 3 |  | There are very few tables that are comfortable typing-height |
|  East London | Hackney | Bernstein's Bar |  | Good |  |  | Small menu but lovely. Open from breakfast until late so you could theoretically stay all day if you wanted. | ££ | Staff are all cool, you will get to know them quickly. | 4 |  | One point knocked off because it's absolutely tiny. Plug sockets only available from one or two points I think. REALLY GOOD if you like visiting dogs, for some reason I've never been there and not seen a dog. |
|  East London | Hackney | Footnote | http://www.footnote.london/ | Very good | Changes regularly | Lots by the windows | Nice posh breakfast/brunch food. Cakes not as good as they used to be but delicious ice cream | ££ | Very friendly. They love dogs. | 5 | £2.50 ish (I am a tea drinker, it's £2.00 for a pot of leaf tea) | Lovely big windows, my favourite place for writing. Gets busy at lunch and occasionally they get laptop people to share tables, but outside of meal times it's a lovely quiet space |
|  East London | Hackney | Jim's Cafe |  | Good |  |  | Nice food, on the experimental rather than the comfort side (like, duck egg hash rather than cheese omelette). | £££ | Nice, unfussed if you just want to stay there the entire day and not even get food. | 4 |  | Point knocked off because it's v dark and expensive. Key though is EVERY table has a plug socket. |
|  East London | Hackney | Palm Vaults |  | Good |  |  | Almost the whole food menu is variants of avocado toast. I think it's all or almost all vegan. Drinks menu is ludicrous and you have about thirty options, many of them caffeine-free, most of them very fancy and instagrammable.. | ££ to £££ | They're intimidatingly cool but all really lovely. | 3 |  | It's extremely pretty, extremely fancy and extremely luxuriously hipster. It's also unfortunately very small and always busy. DO NOT go there at the weekend you will not be able to get a seat. Plenty of plug sockets. No air conditioning and Not Good in heatwaves. |
|  East London | Hackney | Venetia's |  | OK |  |  | Sort of like a slightly less greasy greasy spoon. Reasonably priced. | £ | Nice but not over-friendly. If you need to get stuff done and don't want to have to socialise, good choice. | 3 |  | Not many plugs, dark inside, but they do also have a covered garden out the back. Something weird going on with the wifi I can't figure out but rebooting on my end always seems to fix it. |
|  North London | Hampstead | Silverberry Deli and Kitchen |  | OK |  |  | Good coffee and amazing cake. Good choice of vegan options. | £ | Nice staff don't bother you too much | 4 |  | Nice outside area in the summer. |

Grab a table before lunchtime rush or Herne Hill buggy brigade turn up. Gave me a free coffee they'd accidentally made last time I was there. |
|  Central London | HOLBORN | The Hoxton |  | Great |  |  | Full menu | £££ | Will leave you alone. Not great if you're ordering food lol |  |  | It's a fancy hotel. I saw a high end hooker sex worker there once |
|  East London | Homerton | The Hatch |  | Good |  |  | The best pain au chocolat I've had in London (i'll put money on them being baked by french people). Sweet things, salads, sandwiches, all excellent. | ££ | Friendly enough. Buy some stuff to drink and nibble now and then and you'll have nothing to worry about | 4 |  | If you're feeling flush you can pay a couple of quid to sit upstairs in the gallery set aside ESPECIALLY for the purpose of WORKING, where there are benches and chairs and more plug sockets than you can shake a magsafe apple power charger at. Can be hot however |
|  North London | Islington | Finsbury Library | https://www.islington.gov.uk/libraries-arts-and-heritage/libraries/your-local-libraries/finsbury-library | Very good | get-reading | Plenty | normally no food allowed except water | - | Leave you alone | 4 |  | Can be a bit noisey when the school finishes for the day, there are plenty of plugs and USB charging points, during Tuesdays and Thursdays closes at 8pm. |
|  West London | Kensington | Wayne's Coffee | www.waynescoffee.co.uk/ | Good | Can get WiFi from Seraphine Hotel next door. 24 hours access. |  | Sandwiches, bagels, salad, pastries, juice, coffee and tea. Most of the time there are one or two raw vegan cakes, but these are the only vegan food options. Not sure about gluten free options. There are a few vegetarian options. | £-££ | Very nice. The owner is lovely and he is occasionally around. They aren't bothered by people working on their laptops and usually smile. They occasionally bring orders over to your table for you. | 4 | £1.50 - £3.10 | There's a 20% own cup discount that not all staff are aware of. Fresh lemon or mint tea is more expensive than a tea bag.There's usually music playing, it's not very distracting and can be eaisly drowned out with headphones. It's typical easy listening/coffeeshop music. |
|  North London | Kentish Town | Arancini Brothers |  | Consistently fine. |  |  | Delicious coffee and muffins, cookies etc. Arancini are cheesy, heart-attack-y perfection. | ££ | Super friendly, cool staff. | 5 |  | There's a little garden in the back, which is quiet and ideal. |
|  North London | Kings Cross | Dishoom |  | Great |  |  | Indian. Small plates of stuff, wraps, curries, bread, nice drinks. Bottomless chai! Bacon naan! | £££ (compared to a cafe) | Totally fine | 4 |  | Look, I know. But bear with me. The King's Cross one is massive, and not crazy busy during the day, mid week. You can sit at a booth downstairs, or at the bar upstairs, with a laptop. They will pretty much leave you alone. Food is consistent, and good if you're hungry. Chai is bottomless. Bacon naan kicks off your day really well. |
|  North London | Kings Cross | Drink, Shop, Do | http://drinkshopdo.co.uk/ | Fairly good - have two separate networks incase one goes down |  | Scattered around | Salads, tarts and a lot of cake! | ££ | Really nice staff and quite helpful | 4 | £3 | This is a really nice place, and actually pretty spacious. I'd give it a miss at weekends as it can get pretty packed, but you can pretty much always get a table in the week. Staff are lovely and will leave you too it. |
|  North London | Kings Cross | Le Pain Quotidien [in St Pancras] | http://www.lepainquotidien.co.uk/store/st-pancras/ | Okay |  |  | French food: pastries, salads etc | ££ | Fine | 4 |  | There's huge tables near tha back where you can spread out and work in peace. If you're worried about the tourists, don't be - they usually sit at the front and aren't that loud in any case. Also if you get kicked out at 10pm: 24hr Costa right next door. |
|  South-East London | Lewisham | Lewisham Centre |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Not many 'laptop' cafes in Lewisham yet - there are Costa and Starbucks inside the shopping centre. |

The staff seem to expect you to set up camp for decent amount of time |
|  East London | Mile End | Mae + Harvey |  | Good |  | None | Super nice food, really reasonably price (although fairly small portions) | £ | Staff are super lovely | 3 |  | Only a three as this place is teeny teeny tiny (entire place cannot sit more about 10 people). Usually quiet during the weekday though, so good if you're working alone. |
|  East London | Mile End | The Chesterfield |  | Good, but often off before ~2PM |  |  | Amazing food - all in really big portions. Bagels are great, brownies are heavenly. | £ to ££ | Staff are nice, and happy with you hanging around all day. They can be a bit dozy - I've had my order forgotten, the wrong thing ordered, etc, so many times - but always nice enough. | 4 |  | Various places to sit big tables, little tables, couches, etc). A few plugs but not too many! The tea comes in annoying pots which stew really quickly so despite size, you can only usually get a cup out of them. |
|  South-East London | New Cross | The Red Lion |  | Pretty good |  |  | Good brownies | ££ | Everyone's cool here. | 4 |  | Don't come here on a bright day, as it is a glass box of sweat when it's hot |

Library membership needed. | Yes | None. But you can bring in bottled drinks, due to lack of staff. | – | Friendly, if any are around. | 3 | – | North Finchley Library is only open to the public for a few hours a day. Outside of those hours, you need a membership card to enter. Inside of those hours, the library is staffed by volunteers and professional librarians. At the back of the library there is a large, well-lit room, with loads of tables and chairs. It has the feel of a cheap classroom, and everything echoes a lot, but otherwise it's quiet and there's plenty of space to work. |
|  North London | North Finchley | Artsdepot Cafe | https://www.artsdepot.co.uk/ | Good |  |  | Basic sandwiches, salads and cakes, with tea and coffee. | £ | Friendly. | 4 |  | Three issues with the Artsdepot: plugs are hard to come by for laptop users and get snagged early. It closes early - check its website for opening hours. And finally, the Artsdepot is home to a dance school: so during terms at lunch the cafe gets rammed by teenaged dance students grabbing their lunch: it can feel like you've wandered into a scene from Fame. |
|  South east London | Nunhead | The Old Nuns Head | http://theoldnunshead.co.uk/ | Good |  |  | Street food pop-ups, dinner only, except lunch on Sat / Sun: Burger Bear (Mon, Tues, Sat), Greek (Weds), various (Thurs, Fri), great Sunday roasts. They make a decent coffee - and hot chocolate in winter! | £ | Manager Nick and all staff super lovely and supportive of the arts, esp theatre | 4 |  | Usually fine to spend hours and hours working in there unless massively busy. (Quiz night Thursday 8pm very loud and busy!) Sockets available, ask for a booth (and also elsewhere, ask staff). If you need peace and quiet, and pub is quiet during daytime, ask staff if you can sit upstairs in the function room to work. |

|  Central London | PICCADILLY | Café Monico |  | Very nice |  |  | Full menus | ££ | Excellent | 4.5 |  | Definitely a great place for meetings and/or to work. Looks like it's way to fancy to let you work there, but they're great about it. Excellent service. |
|  Central London | PICCADILLY | Picturehouse Central |  | Decent |  |  | Hot & cold food, coffee and pastries | ££ | Nice | 4 |  | Please boycott - theres a current boycott called by picturehouse's workers until theyre paid living wage. (details: https://www.bectu.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/picturehouse) You'll be left alone even if you sit there all day with your laptop. Does attract tourists who can be noisy. Last time I was in music was very loud, so you may need headphones or earplugs if you need quiet. |
|  South-West London | Putney | Dillons (Waterstones cafe) |  | Excellent |  | Plenty on wall-side booths | Limited daily menu, but solid selection of homemade baked snacks<br/>Wide range of coffees, high quality | ££ | Lovely, usually young, sometimes a bit slow but always friendly and helpful | 3.5 | £2.80 | Very popular in general, but especially so with new parents - I'd recommend headphones<br/>Wifi is excellent and there are plenty of sockets<br/>There's usually space but sharing of booths is encouraged<br/>Tip: ask for your coffee in a takeaway cup, even if you're sitting in. Not sure why exactly but their coffee does tend to go cold quicker |

|  West London | Shepherd's Bush 🐏🐏🐏 | Bush Hall Dining Rooms | t | Good |  |  | All-day breakfasts, sandwiches, burgers, pizzas from 5pm. Iced coffees, iced teas, milkshakes and smoothies. Not many gluten free or vegan options, but staff accommodate. | ££ | Mixed bunch, but young and keen. Most are also in the arts! | 4 |  | Avoid on weekends - busy brunch is loud and it's likely you'll need to book a table to get one. It's also next to a music school for children, so when classes come out around 4pm, it gets noisy. Lots of plug sockets in the lower section, air conditioned, good music. Open until 10pm most days, and fairly quiet in the evenings. |
|  East London | Shoreditch | Barber & Parlour |  | Great |  |  | Good classic hipster cafe food – avocado toasts, brunch-y food, salads, as well as more dinner-like offerings I think. Good coffee, as well as beer and wine. | ££ | Sometimes inattentive and slow, but generally nice and friendly. |  |  | Good food, very comfortable seating. Only plugs in some places – can sometimes be hard to come by, but the ones hidden behind the corner couches are good game. One of the higher quality wifi situations I've come across, and they don't mind you hanging around for hours. |
|  East London | Shoreditch | Google Campus |  | Excellent |  |  | Salads, pastries, great coffee | £ to ££ | Very nice | 5 |  | You'll need to be a member to get involved. [Membership is free.] Cons, foosball table. Pros, super professional environment, so you'll get a ton of stuff done. <br/>Other Cons: Quickly gets rammed, so it's hard to find seats unless you get their early in the day.<br/>Stays open until 8pm, but food and coffee only available until 5pm. |
|  East London | Shoreditch | Pitfield Cafe | https://pitfieldlondon.com/pages/cafe | Good |  |  | AMAZING mix and match fresh salads from the salad bar, pretty good sandwiches and flat breads and then hot food to order which I've never tried | £ | Fairly eccentric and can be slow at busy times | 4 |  | Unsure about plugs, but atmosphere is great - very chill with the occasional 90s banger on the music front. It doubles as a hipster art/furnishings shop so looks great. There's loads of space (there's another seating area at the back, away from the counter) and is quiet outside of lunchtimes. Cheapest 'nice' cafe I've been to in Shoreditch and they're cool about you sitting there with one coffee all day. |
|  East London | Shoreditch | Ace Hotel |  | Great |  |  | Awesome. Try the Eggs Benedict. | ££ - £££ | Really attentive. Almost too attentive | 5 |  | Loads of little spots to sit and work and each one has a different 'aesthetic' if you get bored sitting in the same place. VERY popular with freelancers so get there early for the central table with lamps/plugs. |
|  Central London | SOHO | Yumchaa |  | Decent |  |  |  | ££ | Always perfectly pleasant and ok with you staying there for hours | 4 |  | Open until 9pm most nights, which is weirdly rare for cafes even in central. Can be heaving earlier in the day but a nice, peaceful spot for evening working – and there's a cosy downstairs too. |
|  Central London | SOHO 🍆🍆🍆 | Soho Theatre bar |  | Pretty Good | SohoPublic<br/>peachbellini |  | Coffee good, wine pricey, water (flavoured) for free on the end of the bar! chips & pizza or salad available. | £ to ££ | Utterly super darling, suave & genuinely charming. Apt to add biscuits to the side of regulars coffee. | 4 |  | Wifi is passably fast, there are sockets and booths (but people pounce fast - however sharing is rarely seen as odd) and half the folk in there 10 to 5 are also working, or having meetings. good for hearing indiscreet media or theatre gossip, and overhearing people needing freelancers, or about good auditions |
|  South-West London | South Kensington | Brompton Oratory Cafe |  | Good |  |  | Limited menu - some sandwiches/salads. Incredible donuts. Coffee is good and good range of T2 tea | ££ | Friendly and chill | 4 |  | Not sure about plugs. Some tables not great for typing, but the atmosphere is really nice. Is conjoined with a Christian library if that's not your thing. Don't go on Sunday. edit: last time there weren't any donuts :c hopefully they just ran out and haven't stopped selling them. Also they have an outside section now, idk if the wifi works up there tho. |
|  South-west London | South Kensington | Drayton Arms |  | consistently good | O2 Wifi | Plenty near the sofas | Pub food/fancier stuff. | ££ (but actually reasonable for the area) | Totally chill. | 4 |  | Gets busier/noisier in the evening thanks to theatre upstairs. Brunch menu is awesome but ends at 2pm - highly recommend getting there before that. Coffee isn't the best ever. Generally really nice atmosphere. |
|  South-west London | South kensington | Zacks Deli |  | Extremely patchy |  | Only by the window and long table | Sandwiches and cakes | ££ | Generally fine | 3 | 2.5 | Bad wifi. Coffee was expensive compared to the food which was weird. Food was edible, cakes looked good. |
|  South London | Southbank | National Theatre | https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/ | Pretty good |  |  | Coffee shop with the usual spread, restaurant/kitchen with sandwiches, cakes and hot meals as well, and there's also a pub attached to the building 'The Understudy' where you can still access wifi | ££ | Friendly | 5 |  | Lots of people working there throughout the day, but when they have matinee shows they'll ask you to free up the desks/tables for visitors during the lunch hour and also after 6pm.<br/><br/>When the weather is nice they've got tables outside that you can work from and still connect to the wifi. |
|  South-west London | Surbiton | The Press Room | http://www.pressroomcoffee.co.uk/ | Good, can break occasionally but they'll fix it if you mention |  |  | Sandwiches/wraps/melts, lots of pastries, incredible range of loose tea (not T2 overpriced tat either...) | ££ | Really friendly | 4 |  | They have changed the layout a bit to try and encourage people to not stay but they are very nice and as long as you don't sit all day sucking down one cold cup of tea they'll be fine :) I have hung out there for multiple hours on days I freelanced |
|  Central London | TOTTENHAM COURT RD | Waterstone's Cafe, Basement Floor | https://www.waterstones.com/bookshops/waterstones-tottenham-court-road | Pretty Good |  |  | Lots of teas, coffe, beers and cocktails. Also yummy looking cakes (not tested) | ££ | Super friendly | 4 |  | Its underground so no windows unfortunately. But they do have wifi and there are others around you sitting and working. There are some times events in the eveing but it should be quiet during the day - bring headphones. |
|  Central London | TOTTENHAM COURT RD | The Cafe at Foyles |  | Pretty good |  |  | Everything's kinda fine, no standouts | £££ | Everyone's cool here | 3 |  | It's always busy, like always. Currently there aren't using the gallery space, so it's a lot bigger than usual.  Wifi is good but your VPN won't work if you need to access it. |
|  Central London | TRAFALGAR 🔲 | The National Portrait Gallery | http://www.npg.org.uk/visit/shop-eat-drink/cafe.php | Pretty good |  |  | Consistently good cakes, they do £2 cafetieres | ££ (by central London standards) | Everyone's cool here | 5 |  | They close at 5 SHARP, which can sneak up on you |
|  Central London | TRAFALGAR SQ | The National Gallery |  | Good |  |  | It's a benugo I think | ££ | Pleasant | 4 |  | In the basement espresso cafe, there are plugs and wifi. Almost like having your own desk. Can stay as long as you like (though might have to wait to get a spot while tourists charge their phones). Bring headphones. |
|  Central London | TURNPIKE LANE | Blend |  | Consistently fine. |  |  | Great coffee and good food: hipster sandwiches, breakfast foods & a nice selection of freshly baked cakes! | ££ | Staff & owners are always friendly & helpful | 5 |  | Plenty of plugs sockets. Tap water on a side table so you don't have to queue to ask for some. Gets fairly busy at mealtimes & there are usually families with kids in there. |
|  South London | WEST NORWOOD | Volcano |  | excellent |  |  | Good coffee (they roast in house) food ok but mostly limited to sandwiches etc. | ££ | Nice people | 5 |  | Sat in here for hours and it's fine. Big airy space, not the best food choices but great coffee. |

|  East London | Whitechapel/<br/>Aldgate | Grounded |  | Alright Tosh, got a Toshiba? |  |  | Lovely - niche quiche, good breakfast range, huge toasted sarnies | £ to ££ | Nice, although there's one lady who can get quite grouchy if you're a lone person on a bigger table... | 4 | dfghjukl | Plugs under all the tables by the door, on the left hand side as you walk in. Tends to have very sweet, chatty German tourists (must be on a guide somewhere!) |
